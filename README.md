# Whack-A-Bara

## Description

Whack-A-Bara is a browser-based game inspired by the classic "Whack-A-Mole" arcade game. Players must click on the capybaras that appear to earn points while avoiding caimans. The game is timed, and players must collect as many points as possible before time runs out or they lose all their hearts.
